# BAR Utils

This repository houses two utilities written in Python

1.  **`/api-scraper`**: A fetcher, serves as batch or continuous listener that automatically fetches BAR replay metadata and downloads replay files from the official BAR API.
2.  **`/sql-export-viewer`**: A modular data analytics script that processes CSV exports from a PostgreSQL database to provide simple aggregate data views
